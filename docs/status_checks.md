# GitHub Status Checks

This document explains how GitHub Status Checks are configured and used in this repository.

## What are GitHub Status Checks?

GitHub Status Checks are automated tests that run whenever code is pushed to a repository or a pull request is created. They help ensure code quality, test coverage, and other standards are maintained.

## Status Checks in This Repository

This repository uses the following status checks:

### 1. Quick Tests
- Runs basic tests to quickly validate code functionality
- Uses Python 3.10 for testing
- Executed on every pull request

### 2. Code Quality
- Checks code formatting using Black and isort
- Performs linting with flake8
- Runs type checking with mypy
- Ensures consistent code style and quality

### 3. Security Check
- Scans dependencies for known vulnerabilities using safety
- Performs security analysis with bandit
- Identifies potential security issues before they reach production

### 4. Build Check
- Builds the Python package
- Tests installation of the built package
- Verifies the package can be properly installed and used

### 5. Python Compatibility
- Tests the code with multiple Python versions (3.10, 3.11, 3.12, 3.13)
- Ensures compatibility across different Python environments

### 6. Enhanced Status Aggregator
- Provides comprehensive summary of all status checks
- Creates detailed PR comments with check results
- Offers troubleshooting guidance and next steps
- Tracks project health metrics and trends
- Automatically updates status on each push

## Enhanced Status Aggregator Features

The Enhanced Status Aggregator provides advanced PR management capabilities:

### Automated PR Comments
- Creates comprehensive status reports as PR comments
- Updates automatically on each push
- Provides visual status indicators for each check
- Offers specific troubleshooting guidance

### Status Summary Dashboard
- Shows overall progress percentage
- Lists all checks with current status
- Provides next steps based on current state
- Includes project health metrics

### Intelligent Analysis
- Detects failed checks and provides specific guidance
- Suggests commands to fix common issues
- Links to relevant documentation
- Tracks quality trends over time

### Example Status Report
```markdown
## Automated Status Report

### Check Summary
**Overall Progress**: 4/5 checks passed (80%)

| Check | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Quick Tests | PASS success |
| Code Quality | FAIL failure |
| Security Check | PASS success |
| Build Check | PASS success |
| Python Compatibility | PENDING pending |

### Next Steps
**Action Required**: 1 check(s) failed
- Review failed checks above
- Run: black src/ tests/ to fix formatting
- Push changes to re-run checks

### Quality Metrics
- **Test Coverage**: 100% (Target: 90%)
- **Security Score**: A+ (No vulnerabilities)
- **Code Quality**: Needs attention (Formatting issues)
```

## Required Status Checks

For pull requests to be merged into the main branch, the following status checks must pass:
- Quick Tests
- Code Quality
- Security Check
- Build Check
- Python Compatibility

## Troubleshooting Failed Checks

If a status check fails:

1. Click on the failed check to view details
2. Review the logs to identify the specific error
3. Check the automated status report for specific guidance
4. Make necessary changes to your code
5. Push the changes to update the pull request
6. The status checks will automatically run again

## Adding New Status Checks

To add a new status check:

1. Create or modify a workflow file in `.github/workflows/`
2. Define the new job and its steps
3. Update the status aggregator to recognize the new check
4. Update branch protection rules to require the new check if necessary

## Benefits of Enhanced Status Checks
