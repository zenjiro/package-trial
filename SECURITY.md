## Security Best Practices

When using this package:

1. **Keep dependencies updated**: Regularly update to the latest version
2. **Review code**: This is an open-source project - review the code before use
3. **Validate inputs**: Always validate inputs to the `add_one` function
4. **Use in trusted environments**: This is a demonstration package

## Scope

This security policy applies to:
- The main package code in `src/package_trial_zenjiro/`
- Build and distribution processes
- Documentation and examples

## Out of Scope

The following are considered out of scope:
- Issues in dependencies (report to respective maintainers)
- General Python security issues
- Issues in development tools or test code

## Security Considerations

### Current Security Status

This package:
- Contains minimal code surface area (single function)
- Has no external dependencies in runtime
- Uses standard Python operations only
- Has been thoroughly tested

### Potential Risks

While this is a simple demonstration package, be aware of:
- **Input validation**: The `add_one` function accepts any numeric input
- **Type errors**: Invalid inputs will raise TypeError
- **Numerical overflow**: Very large numbers may cause issues

### Recommendations

For production use:
1. Validate inputs before calling `add_one`
2. Handle potential TypeErrors appropriately
3. Consider numerical limits for your use case
4. Test thoroughly in your environment
